 Simple React Redux testing with Jest
# clone our repo
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/invegat/basic-jest-testing.git

# change directory to our repo
cd react-redux-jest-testing

# install the repo with yarn
yarn install

# run the tests
yarn test

For my level of experience I have " verbose: true" in jest.config.js, to restore the default of false edit or delete jest.config.js.

Most of the code is copied from "Learning Path: Building React Applications with Redux and Flux" Published by Pearson Education 2017 on Safari Books Online https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths/learning-path-building/9780134689197/9780134676920-arjs_13_00 - Though it uses older React Redux testing tools not Jest
